Heart Disease Prediction & Diagnosis
Using Logistic Regression
Dataset Column Description:
age in years
sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp chest pain type
trestbps resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg resting electrocardiographic results
thalach maximum heart rate achieved
exang exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal
Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously)

Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)

Value 2: normal blood flow

Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

target 1 or 0
Context:
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
